# customer_churn-proj
📌 Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn for a bank using machine learning techniques. Customer churn refers to the likelihood of a customer leaving a company’s services. By predicting churn, businesses can take proactive measures to retain customers and improve satisfaction.

This end-to-end project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation using multiple algorithms.

🎯 Objectives
Identify customers who are likely to churn.

Analyze features contributing to churn.

Compare multiple machine learning models to select the best-performing one.

🛠️ Technologies & Tools
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy,  Matplotlib, Seaborn

IDE/Notebook: Jupyter Notebook

📂 Dataset
Source: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shrut... ]

Type: Bank customer data

Features include customer demographics, account details, and activity-related attributes.

🔑 Key Steps
Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values and duplicates

Label encoding and one-hot encoding for categorical variables

Feature scaling using StandardScaler

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize churn patterns

Identify correlations and feature importance

Model Training

Implemented multiple models:

Random Forest

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Gradient Boosting Classifier

Model Evaluation

Used confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy score

Compared performance of different models

Determined feature importance for interpretability

📊 Results
Achieved 86.65 % accuracy with the best-performing model ( Gradient Boosting).

Identified key features influencing churn such as  Age, Balance, CreditScore, Number of Products, and IsActiveMember.
